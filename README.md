## About:
The Watercolour Pen Plotter is a CNC machine designed to operate like a traditional pen plotter but tailored for watercolor painting on traditional 8.5 x 11 paper. The goal is to create a compact, user-friendly frame with an added feature for mixing paint. The CNC machine will paint freely, blending colors and adjusting shades by varying the paint-to-water ratios through an automated process.

## Progress:
 [A detailed file describing the process can be found here](Progress.md)

Summary: 
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Design:
- All components for the CNC machine have been brainstormed and designed. This was mainly done through sketches.
  
CAD:
- All CAD work has been completed for the chassis of the CNC machine on Solidworks. 

Electronics:
- Setup and tested scrap stepper motors that was found from an old machine by running G-code on CNC shield and Arduino Uno.

Work to be complete:
- Potential optimization of material use in chassis
- 3D printing and prototyping
- Running all electrical components with chassis: testing and debugging

## CAD Models:

All SolidWork CAD models were created using SolidWorks 2023. All files for the assembly can be found in the repository.

## External Help (Parts that will be put to use):

The following parts and links are pieces that I plan to use in this project. I used their dimensions to help create my CADs.

Stepper Motors: (Not sure right now, they were scrap motors)

(Any other parts I will update as I move along)
